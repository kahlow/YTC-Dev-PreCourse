    This homework assignment is to create a really bad calculator that takes any 5 numbers 
    and does some random calculation of your choice. Print that number out and then mix up the
    operators and print it again. I want your print statement to have a nice sentence that
    explains your algorithm.
    
    For example, create a program that takes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and prints:
   		"This is what I did 1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5 and this is the answer: 0"
      
    I want you to create a variable for each number.
