#Becomming a developer

This is the first step to an exciting career as a software developer. I bet you can't wait!

Let's start with an exercise that can help you on the road to becoming the best developer you can be. 
I want you to repeat this 3 times out loud. You will be graded on it.
    I am a software developer.
    I am a software developer.
    I am a software developer.

Doesn't that feel great?! Part of being a developer (or anything) is believing you can be. With the skills you'll learn in this class you'll be well on your way to becoming an excellent developer. It takes hard work and diciplen but we both know you have that in spades.

Next, let's get into the mindset of a developer. To do this you'll need to break out the ol' logical part of your brain. Developers can break any task given to them into a simple set of instructions.

Computers are really dumb. Think of your computer as the dumbest person you've ever met. Go ahead and get a mental picture of that person. Aren't they silly?

Anything a computer does needs to be broken down into a simple set of instructions. They only have a general understanding of their internals but they don't know how to put them to use. That's your job.

One excercise that I started out with when I was in school is teaching a computer how to make a sandwich.
