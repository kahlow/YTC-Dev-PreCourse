#Becoming a developer

This is the first step to an exciting career as a software developer. I bet you can't wait!

Let's start with an exercise that can help you on the road to becoming the best developer you can be. 
I want you to repeat this 3 times out loud. You will be graded on it.

    I am a software developer.
    I am a software developer.
    I am a software developer.

Doesn't that feel great?! Part of being a developer (or anything) is believing you can be. With the skills you'll learn in this class you'll be well on your way to becoming an excellent developer. It takes hard work and discipline but we both know you have that in spades.

##Thinking like a developer

In the introduction we came up with an idea of a weather application for smart phones. We were able to break the application down into high level tasks to accomplish our goals. One thing we didn't do is talk about how to actually accomplish each step.

Let's get granular!

First, we need to get into the mindset of a developer. To do this you'll need to break out the ol' logical part of your brain. Developers can break any task given to them into a simple set of instructions.

Computers are really dumb. Think of your computer as the dumbest person you've ever met. Go ahead and get a mental picture of that person. Aren't they silly?

Anything a computer does needs to be broken down into a simple set of instructions. They only have a general understanding of their internals (an API) and they don't know how to put them to use. That's your job.

One exercise that I started out with when I was in school is teaching a computer how to make a sandwich. Pretend you already have all of the ingredients in front of you.

######User Story: As a hungry user, I want to make a sandwich.

High level steps:

    Make sandwich

Granular steps:

    Place bread on plate
    Apply peanut butter to bread
    Add bananas
    Apply second layer of bread

That's a very high level set of instructions. What if you had to break it down even further by instruction your hand how to pick the bread up? This exercise can lead you into an infinite amount of steps. Go ahead and take some time to see how far you can go down that rabbit hole. I'll be here when you get back.

##Clean code
Clean code is something you should strive for. Clean code is readable and well documented.

###Indent and white space
You should use as much white space as you need. Conditional statements and loops should be tabbed correctly.

####Protip
>Use the tab key on your keyboard to keep your code readable!

###Organized
You should group code that interacts together. For example, don't declare a variable at the top of a function and then only reference it on the last line of your function. This causes your code to be really hard to read.

###Comments
Always comment your code. Even better, write code that comments itself. Use your variable names and workflow to explain what you're doing. For example, name your variable used to hold a person's first name 'firstName'. If your variable is named 'firstName' you won't have to comment that it's used for first names. Make sense?
