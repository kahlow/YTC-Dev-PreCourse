1. Write an if statement that evaluates two numbers to see if they're equal. If true, print "They are equal!". If false, print "They are not equal!".
2. Give a reason for using a switch statement over an if statement.
3. What happens if you don't use a `break` in a switch statement?
4. Change this nested if statement into a single if statement:
    
    $con1 = True;
    $con2 = False;

    if ($con1) {
        if !($con2) {
            echo "HERE!";
        }
    }
