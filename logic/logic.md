#Logic

Let's look at a statement that you haven't seen before and I want you to think about what in the world the answer could be.

    1 + 2 == 3 AND 2 + 2 == 4 OR 5 > (2 + 3)

Think really hard before you glance down at the answer! 

Let's take the above statement and break it into pieces. 

I like to throw in parenthesis to make things clearer. (I hope you know your order of operation! If not, google it!)

    (1 + 2 == 3) AND (2 + 2 == 4) OR (5 > (2 + 3))

Using arithmetic and logical operators this newly grouped statement can become this:

    True AND True OR False
