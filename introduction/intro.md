#Introduction

##What is a program?

A program is a set of instructions that can be executed in an operating system. I'm using the phrase *operating system* because I don't think it's safe to use the word computer anymore. Computers have a connotation of being desktop PCs or laptops. That's not really true. A computer is any device that can execute instructions or programs. Most likely the mobile phone in your pocket is a super computer. Even if your phone is not a smart phone, it runs an operating system and has many, many programs. The car you drive has a *computer* that makes decisions based on conditions it deems suitable to decide upon. I don't know anything about cars but you get the idea.

I've used the word program but you've probably heard programs called many things. Apps, software, executables, scripts. These are all terms that are interchangeable in the right context. Normally you don't say your tablet runs scripts, but a script is a just a collection of text instructions, which is a program.

Being a programmer means you can command these devices to bend to your will. Think of the power. The power! Muah ha ha ha..

##Exercise 1

Let's try to think of a new program right now. 

First, let's think of a platform. Let's pick smart phone since they're so popular right now.

Next, let's think of a task. How about telling a user the current temperature where they are located.

Platform: Smart Phone
App(program): Local weather

This may seem like a huge undertaking but let's break it into smaller pieces. What does your app need to do to successfully tell a user the local weather?

1. Get user location
2. Query weather service for local temperature
3. Find cute cat picture
4. Display temperature and cute cat picture.
5. Make you a million dollars

Each one of those steps seems really complicated, and they probably are at first, but most devices have something called an API which is a set of tools for building software applications. Sure it'll take time to learn the API but once you do you'll be surprised at what you can do.

The first step in writing any program is to break the high level instructions into manageable steps. I like to use the business term of *user story*. A *user story* is a sentience or two describing a user interaction. "As a smart phone user, I want to be able to see a cute cat and the weather." These user stories are then broken down into tasks like the ones above.

*The trick to being a software developer is confidence and time.*
