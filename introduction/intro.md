##What is a program?

A program is a set of instructions that can be executed in an operating system. I'm using the phrase *operating system* because I don't think it's safe to use the word computer anymore. Computers have a connotation of being desktop PCs or laptops. That's not really true. Programs are on all devices, not just your home computer. Most likely the mobile phone in your pocket is a super computer. It runs an operating system and has many, many programs. The car you drive has a *computer* that makes decisions based on conditions it deems suitable to decide upon. (I don't know anything about cars)

I've used the word program but you've probably heard programs called many things. Apps, software, executables, scripts. These are all terms that are interchangeable in the right context. Normally you don't say your tablet runs scripts, but a script is a just a collection of text instructions, which is a program.
