#Operators

An operator is a special character that can be used to return a value or perform an action. You'll see what we mean by 'value' and 'action' below.

First, there are two types of operators.
* Arithmetic
* Logical

Let's take a look at some examples of operators and you'll see that it's an easy concept to learn.

    =
    >
    <
    +
    -
    /
    \
    ()
    % (modulus)
    And
    Or
    Not

Note:
>In our pseudo code we've been using the equals sign '=' to assign or compare values. Normally you'll see the use of a double equals == to compare values.

There are many many more operators than the ones listed. To see a list of operators by programming langauge take a look at the wiki page: [Operator_(computer_programming)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)#Operator_features_in_programming_languages)

##Arithmetic

We've been using these all along but we never really talked about it until now. When doing addition, you're using an operator that looks like this: `+`. See, that's so easy!

The arithmetic operators:

    + | addition
    - | subtraction
    / | real division (keeps remainder)
    \ | integer division (drops remainder)
    % | modulus (just the remainder from using division)
    
##Logical

Logical operators normally return a `True` or `False` value.

    And
    Or
    Not
    =
    >
    <
