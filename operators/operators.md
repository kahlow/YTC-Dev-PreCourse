#Operators

>An operator is a special character that can be used to return a value or perform an action. You'll see what we mean by 'value' and 'action' below.

First, there are two types of operators.
*Arithmetic
*Logical

Let's take a look at some examples of operators and you'll see that it's an easy concept to learn.

    =
    >
    <
    +
    -
    /
    % (modulus)
    And
    Or
    Not

Note:
>In our pseudo code we've been using the equals sign '=' to assign or compare values. Normally you'll see the use of a double equals == to compare values.

We've been using these all along but we never really talked about it until now. When doing addition, you're using an operator that looks like this: '+'. See, that's so easy!
